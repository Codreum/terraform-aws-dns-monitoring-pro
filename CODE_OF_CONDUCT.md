# Code of Conduc

## Our Pledge

We, as contributors and maintainers of this project, pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

This project is an infrastructure/IaC module. Discussions may include production risks, security concerns, and operational constraints. We commit to communicating with empathy, clarity, and respect—especially when reviewing code that could impact reliability or safety.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Being respectful, considerate, and constructive

- Using welcoming and inclusive language

- Giving and receiving feedback professionally (assume good intent; focus on the work)

- Being mindful of how communication tone can be interpreted in tex

- Prioritizing safety and correctness when discussing infrastructure changes

- Respecting differing viewpoints and experiences

- Gracefully accepting responsibility and apologizing when appropriate

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Harassment, intimidation, discrimination, or personal attacks

- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, or “dogpiling”

- Public or private harassment, threats of violence, or encouraging harm

- Publishing others’ private information (“doxxing”) without explicit permission

- Sexual language or imagery, or unwelcome sexual attention

- Deliberate disruption of discussions, reviews, or collaboration

- Pressuring maintainers to merge changes by escalating tone or urgency

- Knowingly promoting unsafe practices (e.g., encouraging insecure defaults) without clearly labeling risks and trade-offs

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and official communication channels, including but not limited to:
